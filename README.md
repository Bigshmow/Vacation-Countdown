# Vacation-Countdown and to-do list builder

### This mobile focused application is designed to keep track of all your To-dos and inspire a sense of excitement with the countdown clock!

## Technologies to be used:
  * Node
  * React
    * shying away from class usage to experiment and learn the useState and useEffect hooks
  * Express
    * easily establish router and middleware
    * using Axios for HTTP req
  * MongoDB
    * Mongoose for modeling
  
## Work in progress...check back soon for universal application as it is currently geared towards my individual use!

## If you'd like to use the project for personal use you will need to:
 * clone/fork the repo
 * install dependencies at the root (using `npm i` will cd into `/client` also)
 * seed a MongoDB with 3 documents following the current model
    * will include a default seed soon!
 * run `npm run start` and have local:3000 and 3001 free
 * Enjoy!
